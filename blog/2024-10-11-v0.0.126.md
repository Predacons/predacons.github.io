* Bug Fixes
<!-- truncate -->

* Removed problematic dependencies (torch and bitsandbytes) from the installation requirements to prevent potential installation issues.

## Chores

* Deleted the GitHub Actions workflow for automating package uploads to Test PyPI.
* Enhanced documentation within the predacons module to clarify function parameters and purposes.

## Example
``` python

# Generate embeddings for sentences
from predacons.src.embeddings import PredaconsEmbedding

# this embedding_model object can be used directly in every method langchain   
embedding_model = PredaconsEmbedding(model_name="sentence-transformers/paraphrase-MiniLM-L6-v2")
sentence_embeddings = embedding_model.get_embedding(["Your sentence here", "Another sentence here"])
```
