## Walkthrough
The pull request updates the PDF handling across the project by replacing the old `PyPDF2` library with `pypdf`. This change is reflected in the import statement in the data loading module, the dependency specifications in both `requirements.txt` and `setup.py`, and the version constraints therein. Additionally, the Predacons version number has been incremented in both the printed rollout message and the package metadata.
